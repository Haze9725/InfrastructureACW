# Infrastructure ACW
Here you can find my reports for the Infrastructure module, 
- The VM report task was to create a remote virtual network for students and lecturers through ArchLinux.
- Due to Covid19, and the movement to remote working, this virtual network had to be created remotely rather than locally as expected.
- The infrastructure report was to design and deploy a network solution for the university campus, making use of network topologies and managing the cost of equipment that might be needed
